### AI for recipes 
This AI using the neural network to find for a given recipe the ingredients and the preparation. 
The data is based on a set from [www.chefkoch.de](https://www.chefkoch.de/), which contains ~13.000 recipes with the corresponding preparations and ingredients.

Further options are planned: 
- ask the AI for ingredients, you want in your meal and they will give you a small result-list with possible recipes, based on the given ingredients
- if the AI found the recipe, they will be possible to ask you in a context, if you just want the ingredients or the preparations

### AI for financial predictions
